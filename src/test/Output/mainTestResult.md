# Java Arrays
- An **array** is a collection of variables of the same type
 
## Declaring an Array
- General Form: type[] arrayName;
- only creates a reference
- no array has  actually been created yet
 
## Creating an Array (Instantiation)
- General form:  arrayName = new type[numberOfElements];
- numberOfElements must be a positive Integer.
- Gotcha: Array size is not modifiable once instantiated.
